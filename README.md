# Oh-My-AnyCLI

Reusable skills, slash commands, subagents, and plugins for multiple AI agent CLIs — pure markdown + bash, no runtime.

## What It Provides

- **38 skills** for review, testing, docs, DevOps, DB, API, security, sandboxed browser testing, and language-specific workflows (C/C++, Rust, C#, Tizen).
- **39 slash commands** that route common tasks to those skills.
- **12 subagents** pinned to `model: cline/default` for OpenCode-AnyCLI compatibility.
- **`omac` CLI** for target-aware listing, searching, selected install/remove, updating, and diagnosing the collection.
- **Plugin slot** for team- or project-specific extensions, including native opencode payloads such as the bundled MIT-licensed `caveman` plugin.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JSUYA/oh-my-anycli.git ~/.oh-my-anycli
~/.oh-my-anycli/install.sh --no-symlink
~/.oh-my-anycli/omac skill list
~/.oh-my-anycli/omac skill install code-review --target claude
```

`install.sh` is kept as a legacy OpenCode bulk installer. Prefer `omac skill install` and `omac plugin install` for selected installs.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |

| `omac list [-v]` | List universal skill/plugin status across Claude, Codex, and OpenCode targets. |
| `omac search <keyword>` | Search frontmatter metadata. |
| `omac info <name>` | Show one artifact's frontmatter. |

| `omac skill remove <name> [--target universal\|claude\|codex\|opencode]` | Remove managed selected skill installs. |
| `omac plugin list [--target universal\|claude\|codex\|opencode]` | List plugin status for one target or the universal matrix. |
| `omac plugin add <git-url>` | Add an external plugin to the local registry. |
| `omac plugin install <name\|all> [--target universal\|claude\|codex\|opencode]` | Install selected plugin(s). |
| `omac plugin remove <name> [--target universal\|claude\|codex\|opencode]` | Remove managed plugin artifacts but keep the registry copy. |
| `omac plugin delete <name>` | Delete a plugin from the local registry. |
| `omac update [--prune]` | Pull latest and reapply to your opencode config. |
| `omac doctor` | Check installation status. |
| `~/.oh-my-anycli/uninstall.sh` | Remove manifested files (keeps your own additions). |

### Command Details

Target option:

- `--target universal` is the default view. It shows Claude, Codex, and OpenCode status side by side.
- `--target claude`, `--target codex`, and `--target opencode` limit a command to one agent target.
- For install/remove commands, `--target universal` applies to all supported targets.
- `--global` uses the user's agent config roots. This is the default.
- `--local` uses project-local roots: `.claude`, `.codex`, and `.opencode`.

Status values:

- `active`: installed by `omac` and identical to the registry source.
- `modified`: installed by `omac`, but the target file was edited after install.
- `present`: a matching file exists, but `omac` does not own it.
- `missing`: no matching target artifact exists.

Skill commands:

- `omac skill list`: Shows every registry skill and whether it is installed for Claude, Codex, and OpenCode. Use `--target claude`, `--target codex`, or `--target opencode` to see one target only.
- `omac skill status <name>`: Shows one skill's status and destination path per target.
- `omac skill install <name>`: Copies one skill from `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` into the selected target. It refuses to overwrite unmanaged files unless `--force` is used.
- `omac skill install all`: Installs every registry skill into the selected target.
- `omac skill remove <name>`: Removes only files that `omac` owns through its selected-install manifest. Unmanaged user files are left in place.

Plugin commands:

- `omac plugin list`: Shows every registry plugin and whether its managed artifacts are installed for each target.
- `omac plugin add <git-url>`: Clones the plugin into `plugins/<name>/` only. It updates the local registry, but does not install or activate the plugin in any agent.
- `omac plugin install <name>`: Installs the selected plugin's supported artifacts into the selected target. OpenCode native payloads under `opencode/` are copied and JS plugin files are registered in `opencode.json`.
- `omac plugin install all`: Installs every registry plugin into the selected target.
- `omac plugin remove <name>`: Removes the plugin artifacts that `omac` installed for the selected target, but keeps `plugins/<name>/` in the registry.
- `omac plugin delete <name>`: Deletes the plugin's registry checkout from `plugins/<name>/`. It does not replace `plugin remove`; remove installed artifacts first when needed.

Compatibility alias:

- `omac skills` is accepted as an alias for `omac skill`.

Examples:

```bash
omac skill list
omac skills --target universal list --global
omac skill --target claude
omac skill install code-review --target claude
omac skill install all --target opencode
omac skill remove code-review --target claude

omac plugin add https://github.com/acme/my-omac-plugin.git
omac plugin list
omac plugin install my-omac-plugin --target opencode
omac plugin remove my-omac-plugin --target opencode
omac plugin delete my-omac-plugin
```

## Plugins

Plugins package shareable skills, commands, and agents outside the core collection. Use `omac plugin add <git-url>` to install one, `omac plugin remove <name>` to remove it.

**Bundled**
- `caveman` — native opencode caveman mode (commands, skills, AGENTS.md ruleset); MIT-licensed payload from [JuliusBrussee/caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman)

Core artifacts install with a `<plugin>__` prefix (`skills/<plugin>__<skill>/SKILL.md`, etc.) to avoid collisions. Files under `opencode/` are copied verbatim without a prefix. See [docs/plugin-authoring.md](docs/plugin-authoring.md) for the full contract.
